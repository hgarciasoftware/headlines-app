headlines-app provides a stream of headlines from over 50 countries and 7 categories for users seeking news from a variety of sources. headlines-app is [powered by news api](https://newsapi.org/).

### while making this app i learned:

- how to debug iOS websites without a mac

- more about relative length units, such as `em` and `rem`

### and i got more practice with:

- responsive layouts

### and i took inspiration from:

- https://dailyread.netlify.app/

- https://design-system.w3.org/

### there's a lot that could still be done, like:

- using a more robust reverse proxy or api gateway

### but sometimes it's better to keep it ssimple :kissing_cat:
